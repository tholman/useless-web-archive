One Square Minesweeper is one of those projects that have sat in my todo list for a long long time, something that would be almost in a sense the fastest easiest game that you can win, but also lose equally easy.

**Why A Single Square?**

Ultimately I never really took to the game minesweeper, I had won the smaller one a few times but really liked the idea of one huge square being a single conglomerate mine. Initially I had it large but in the end it almost felt more comical when I could shrink it down to a very un-threatening one square.

&nbsp;  
**How did you build this?**

Truly I had been procrastinating on this for a while, and predominantly because pulling all of the images together that would look good and be in the retro style just seemed like one of those boring tasks I never do very well at, but fortunately I stumbled upon a fully [open source minesweeper](https://github.com/leyanlo/minesweeper/), which had a full set of assets that I could use as well as some clear layouts... once I had that it was more a matter of stripping out the unwanted functionality.

**What is the win to loss ratio?**

Ahh, sadly (or happily) it's not something I've been tracking, but based on a few tweets that I've observed it seems pretty clear that a lot of people are straight up clicking the mine square not really remembering that in minesweeper you need a right click to flag the mine.

&nbsp;  
**Is there anything else special about this project?**

There is! The project was built and launched as part of Netlify's [Dusty Domains](https://dusty.domains/) project, where for each project built and launched on an old domain money was donated to charity! Ultimately over a hundred thousand dollars was raised for a variety of individual charities.

&nbsp;  
**Is there anything more to it?**

Haha, absolutely not. One Square Minesweeper is [open sourced](https://github.com/tholman/one-square-minesweeper) although I guess all in all I would consider it 'complete'
