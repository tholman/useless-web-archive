When you're staring into this beautiful pug in a rug the world fades away and nothing else matters... at least, thats what it felt like building this beautiful time waster. A true ommage to the beautiful world of pugs, as well as some of the most time consuming sites in existance.

**First things first, is this your pug?**

It is not!

**How many levels 'of pug' are there in pug in a rug?**

**Is there any special sauce in this site? How was it made?**

Hmmm, special sauce. There are a few little nuances that were accidental that have had some surprising effects. At the moment when you're sitting on the page accumulating your, I don't know what I'd call them, "honoring pug points" you can grow levels. The thing is though, if you've got the tab open but unfocused in another screen the counter will still continue to increase, but the browser will do some tricky business to make sure the tab isn't taking up too many resources, which means the counter may miss its exact seconds counted to level you up... this results in lots of seconds without as many levels. A happy accident really.

**So we have a horse, a pug, a pigeon and cats... what animals are next on [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com)?**

That is a good point, The Useless Web is a veritable zoo, often with these animal-based sites being some of the most popular out there. I guess at the end of the day these cute and weird animals are just catchy, funny and memerable. There's about animals that can really inspire people's weird creativity as well!

If I were to say there's anything missing, I'd say it's frogs or turtles. I've got a couple of turtle ideas come to think of it, especially considering they're known to be slow they'll fit perfectly in my great desire of time-wastey simple fun. So I guess watch this space!
